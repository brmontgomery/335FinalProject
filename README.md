# 335 Final Project

For this project, we were tasked with implementing sorting different sorting algorithms to a randomized list of integers. 

For extra points, I converted a previously completed OpenGL Project that I had made to visualize the sorting process. 

I have a similar repository that has more features and better extensibility named Algo_View.
